You will need to set up your Raspberry Pi to take part in this activity. See the [Raspberry Pi Start Guide](http://www.raspberrypi.org/help/quick-start-guide/) to get you up and running.

You will also require a Raspberry Pi camera module connected to your Raspberry Pi. See the [Raspberry Pi Camera Guide](http://www.raspberrypi.org/help/camera-module-setup/) to connect your camera to your Raspberry Pi. Then follow the [Raspberry Pi Camera Setup Tutorial](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/python-picamera-setup) to enable the camera, test it, and download the `picamera` library.

Next, you will need a Pibrella board attached to the GPIO pins on your Raspberry Pi. See the [Pibrella](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/pibrella-setup) guide to learn how to add the board and download the `pibrella` library.

Phew; that is a fair bit of setup, but it will be worth it in the end.
