> Hamsters are nocturnal, which means that they sleep in the daytime and come out at night. This means that when you are sleeping, your hamsters are up and about and when you are up and about, your hamsters are sleeping!

We need to find some way of being able to see what the hamsters are up to during the night. I suspect they are partying.

In this project, we are going to use a Raspberry Pi camera and a Pibrella with a Raspberry Pi to take pictures and video of the hamsters, triggered by their movement.
